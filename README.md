# JobScraper 3000‚Ñ¢ üöÄ (Now with 10% Fewer Existential Crises!)
_Your Overly Ambitious, Semi-Functional Job Search Sidekick_

### What Even Is This?

Do you enjoy manually scrolling through 500 nearly identical job listings? No? Cool, me neither. This is a Python script that:

  1. Scrapes job listings (currently only seek.com.au).
  2. Begs an LLM (Mistral, because GPT-4 costs more than my daily coffee budget) to turn messy text into ‚ú®clean JSON‚ú®.
  3. Pretends it‚Äôs a Real Project‚Ñ¢ by vaguely promising to expand to other sites (LinkedIn, I‚Äôm coming for you‚Ä¶ eventually).

### Perfect for:

* People who think ‚Äúautomation‚Äù is a personality trait.
* Developers who enjoy explaining to LLMs that ‚ÄúFull-Stack Wizard‚Äù isn‚Äôt a real job title.
* Anyone who wants JSON so pristine it could win a Nobel Prize in Formatting.

### Current Status

MVP (Minimally Viable Panic):
* Scrapes Seek.com.au. Mostly.
* Uses Mistral/Ollama to clean data. Warning: LLM may judge your career choices.

Future Goals (read: delusions):
* Add support for 100+ sites. Or, you know, at least one more.
* Make the LLM stop asking for a raise.
* Build a frontend that doesn‚Äôt look like it was designed in 1998.

### Features vs. Future Lies

What It Does Now	-> What I‚Äôll ‚ÄúDefinitely‚Äù Add Later
* üï∑Ô∏è Scrapes Seek ->	ü¶Ñ Scrapes LinkedIn, Indeed, etc. (pinky swear)
* ü§ñ LLM cleans data ->	ü§Ø LLM writes your cover letters (chaos mode)
* üì¶ Outputs JSON ->	üé® Fancy frontend (with dark mode, because we‚Äôre not monsters)
* ‚è≥ Runs slower than a sloth on melatonin	-> ‚ö° Optimizes to ‚Äúblink and you‚Äôll miss it‚Äù speed

### Installation (for the brave)

Clone this repo (because copy-pasting code is so 2004)
```
git clone https://github.com/x0byte/job_search_script_selenium.git
```


### Sample Output (LLM‚Äôs version of ‚Äúhelpful‚Äù)

```
{  
  "title": "Senior Coffee Infrastructure Engineer",  
  "advertiser": "Starbucks Overlords Inc.",  
  "work_type": "Full-time (but also always on-call)",  
  "skills": ["Espresso mastery", "Surviving on 2 hours of sleep", "Crying in the break room"],  
  "description": "We want a rockstar-ninja-guru who will grind (beans) for equity!"  
}
```

### Disclaimer

Not responsible for:
* Getting banned from Seek.com.au.
* Existential dread caused by job descriptions.
* The LLM suggesting you switch careers to llama farming.
